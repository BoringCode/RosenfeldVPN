> Simple status page for a home network VPN

I made this app as a lightweight status page to install on my local home network. It allows toggling OpenVPN on and off. The status page also uses an external service to grab the perceived location of the network.

## Requirements

- PHP5+
- OpenVPN 

## Setup

Clone the git repository into your webserver and visit the page.
